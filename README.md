## Bouncing ball game

### Introduction
 There are balls with different colors moving at a random but uniform velocity. When balls hit the wall or each other, they bounce. The user will move the collector located at the bottom of the window horizontally to catch the balls to meet the requirement within the time limit.


### How to run the game
1. Clone the project.
2. (Recommended) Create a python virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).
4. Run the game.py file.





### Future improvements
1. Currently numbers of balls and their velocity are fixed. In the future, users should be able to edit these fields in a settings screen (with validations of user inputs).
2. Add more features to the game.
3. Restructure the code and make the codebase more readable and easier to maintain.
